# datasci_9_data_prep
Focus on selecting datasets suitable for a machine learning experiment, with an emphasis on data cleaning, encoding, and transformation steps necessary to prepare the data.

# Dataset Selection

+ The first dataset selected from [Data.gov](https://data.gov/): [Office-based Health Care Providers Database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/office-based-health-care-providers-database)
  + It calculates the counts of of medical doctors, doctors of osteopathy, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants at the state and county level from 2011 through 2013.
+ The second dataset selected: [Takata Recall](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/takata-recall)
  + It tracks various progress indicators for the recall of tens of millions of vehicles with Takata air bags. As it had been shown that long-term exposure to high heat and humidity can cause these air bags to explode when deployed. Such explosions have caused injuries and deaths.

# Data Cleaning and Transformation Plan

+ create all folders and pyth0n files 
+ pip install sklearn
+ pip install xgboost

# Dataset Splitting

+ Document each step of your process. Include screenshots of any errors encountered and how you resolved them.
+ Explain your decisions during the data cleaning and transformation process.
